Hi there! My name is Luigi and I am a statistician by education and a data scientist by profession but mainly by passion . 
I enjoy convincing machine learning models to behave and solve real-world problems—when they’re not too busy overfitting or throwing cryptic errors at me.

I’ve always struggled to answer the question, “What do you do for a living?” Not long ago, I used to say "statistician" and people would stare blankly, with someone inevitably mentioning pie charts. These days, I say "data scientist". They smile, nod... and quickly change the subject. At least the pie charts are finally off the table. But if someone insist on knowing more about it I mention the dark art of making predictions out of thin air.

🔍 Expertise: Statistical modeling, predictive analytics, and teaching machines to pretend they’re smarter than they are.
🛠️ Tools I use: Mostly R and Python, because why settle for one language when you can have the best of both worlds (and twice the bugs)?
📊 Skills: Making sense of messy data (EDA) and creating visuals that (hopefully) impress people.
📚 Continuous Learner: Always chasing the latest AI trends, because staying relevant is an extreme sport.
